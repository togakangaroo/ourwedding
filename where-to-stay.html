	There is a large anasthesiology convention in town the weekend of October 11th so large hotel space will be limited. We recommend people find
	accomodations in <a href="http://www.bbnola.com/">bed & breakfasts</a>. There are many nice ones around with a lot of them actually being
	advertised on <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/New-Orleans--Louisiana?af=1922719&c=A_TC%3Dd3qe53k35r%26G_MT%3De%26G_CR%3D28783373776%26G_N%3Dg%26G_K%3Dnew%20orleans%20bed%20and%20breakfasts%26G_P%3D&gclid=CjwKEAjwp7WgBRCRxMCLx8mMnDMSJADncxS2_a4u5GxgghiZBBZDTqbQ2bJAtqjnJ1CPPuLf6C5eBBoC-OPw_wcB">Airbnb</a>

	To try and help with this I've created the below map to try and help. All colored areas are fine to look in with the greener areas being more ideal
	to exploring the walkable parts of the city.
